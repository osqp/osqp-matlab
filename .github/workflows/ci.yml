    # As of May 28, 2021 Matlab isn't able to be used on Windows or Linux on GitHub shared runners
    # (it errors saying the dependencies aren't available on those platforms). Instead we can only
    # test on ubuntu-latest. The matrix below is preserved here in case Matlab support is added
    # to those other platforms.
