    # As of January 19, 2022, the MATLAB action has undocumented support for Windows and MacOS shared runners
    # (https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab/issues/18#issuecomment-1006990188). This is in version
    # 1.1.0 of the action, and only provides the bare Matlab and Simulink products with no toolboxes.
    #
    # Lock the Windows version to 2019 because the 2022 image doesn't include a supported compiler for the
    # available MATLAB version (https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab/issues/29#issuecomment-1048390901).
